# Scope

The RDF/JS SHACL-UI Task Force is a focus group of the RDF/JS Community Group.

The objective is to enhance the SHACL ontology to cater specifically to the UI use cases for application development and data exploration.
It covers reading, writing and querying RDF data.
Interfaces for reusable UI components should be established.
To achieve this, we aim for implementations to rely on the SHACL ontology and the UI extension, enabling them to select UI components and generate layouts.
The defined interfaces will enable seamless communication between implementations and UI components, enabling efficient reading, writing or querying of RDF data.
Whenever feasible, we will utilize other RDF/JS specifications.

Currently, the SHACL-UI Task Force does not address matters regarding loading shapes or the integration of APIs such as GraphQL, LDP, or Hydra.
Interaction with other data is specified only in SPARQL since it's possible to rely on existing SHACL features.
If there is sufficient interest within the group, the topic may be covered at a later stage after the ontology extension and component interfaces have reached a certain stability.
